Differenece between String s="Hello" and String s=new Hello() whichis better?
ANS: Jvm creates string object with a given value in a seperate block of memory
String s=new Hello(): new object with the given value is created.
so i think String s=new Hello() is better

2.Why string is non primitive datatype?
Ans:beacause only class can have method but primitive is not.
3.why cannot we write ArrayList lst=new Arraylist();?
Ans:we can write ArrayList lst=new Arralist() but it specift the datatype
