Exception:An exception is an unwanted or unexpected event,which occurs during the exceution of program.
exception are the errors that can be handled through program.
try with catch
try without catch
try catch finally
try finally
package exception1;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
public class Pratice1 {
public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{
	File f=new File("myFile.txt");
	try(FileWriter fw=new FileWriter(f);)
	{
		fw.write("bye");
	}
	System.out.println("--------------");
	try {
		int a=10;
		int b=0;
		int c=a/b;
	}
	
	catch(Exception e) {
		System.out.println("cannot divide by zero");
	}finally {
		System.out.println("used for closing and releasing object");
	}
}
}
	
 types of Exception:
checked exception
unchecked exception
 checked exception: checked exception are called compile-time exceptions because these exceptions are checked at compile-time by the compile.

Example:
import java.io.*;
class Example {  
public static void main(String args[]) 
   {
FileInputStream fis = null;
 fis = new FileInputStream("B:/myfile.txt"); 
int k; 

while(( k = fis.read() ) != -1) 
	{ 
System.out.print((char)k); 
}
fis.close();
}
}

unchecked ex
ception:
unchecked exception are just opposite to the checked exceptions.
The compiler wii not check these exceptions at compile time
Example:
class UncheckedExceptionExample1 {    
   public static void main(String args[])  
   {  
  int postive = 35;  
 int zero = 0;  
 int result = positive/zero;
System.out.println(result):
}
}
Thread:
Thread is a small chunck of a big process.
we can create thread in java 2 ways
a.Extends thread class
b.implement runnable interface
the logic that needs to be executed is written inside a overriden method i.e: run() method
we should call method instead of directly calling run method
we cannot directly call start method inside rennable thread- because we dont have start method inside runnable interface
package thread;
public class Thread1 {
	// synchronous-one after another-process
	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		A a = new A();
		a.start();
		B b = new B();
		Thread th =new Thread( 	b);
		th.start();
		
		
	}
	

}
class A extends Thread {
	public void run() {
		for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {
			System.out.println("----a---" + i);
			try {
				Thread.sleep(1000);
			} catch(InterruptedException e) {
			}
		}
	}
}
class B implements Runnable
{
	public void run() {
		for (int i=0; i<10; i++){
			System.err.println("-----b-----" + i);
			try {
				Thread.sleep(1000);
			} catch (InterruptedException e) {
			}
		}
	}
}
					
				
		
thread exists in several states:
new(Ready to run)
running
suspended
blocked
terminated
new:thread is a new when it gets cpu time.
when a new thread is created it is the new state
running: a thread is a running state when it is under exception
suspended: thread is in the suspended state when it is temporarily inactive or under execution.
blocked: thread is in the blocked state when it is waiting for resources
terminated: thread is in terminated or dead state when its run() method exits
creation of thread:
we can create thread in java two ways
a.Extend thread class
b.implement runnable interface
a.Extend thread class example:

class Multi extends Thread{  
public void run(){  
System.out.println("thread is running...");  
}  
public static void main(String args[]){  
Multi t1=new Multi();  
t1.start();  
 }  
}  

b.implement runnable interface example:

class Multi2 implements Runnable{  
public void run(){  
System.out.println("thread is running...");  
}  
  
public static void main(String args[]){  
Multi2 m1=new Multi2();  
Thread t1 =new Thread(m1);  
t1.start();  
 }  
}
